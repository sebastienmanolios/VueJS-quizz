  You have to answer 10 questions about comics.  

  This project is made with vuejs

  Made partly in https://bootstrap-vue.org/  
  Calling https://opentdb.com/ API  
  Using https://lodash.com/ library

  Thanks to Gwen Faraday ! I lived code with her for this project

  I am going to add some more functionnalities

  - Prevent to go over 10 questions 
  - Add a component to display the final score
  - Prevent to use "next" button until we submit the answer
  - Choose quiz by theme in adding a parent component which will call the API depending of the choosen theme
